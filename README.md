# 12AU7-Headphone-Amplifier
Headphone amplifier with 12AU7 preamp section. Based from the Bravo Audio V2 amplifier.

I've been using a Bravo Audio V2 headphone amplifier for probably ten years now. The build quality is bad and it's a miracle that it has lasted just this long. It's had multiple repairs, modifications and heavy use for the whole time. I went to find a new one and they have since disappeared from the internet. Well, perfect excuse to build a replica where cost is not an issue.

This is a replica of how my own amplifier is currently working. I've designed it to use the power supply from my existing unit. The modifications made to this are: better quality output MOSFETs, better quality current regulators, a better choice of input capacitor value, removal of useless bridge between valve heaters, larger regulator heatsink and removal of parts I never use.

V1 does and doesn't work. With some botches it is now working perfectly. Version 1.1 has the fixes implemented but as of yet untested. I'm 99% confident that it will work just fine. Once tested the larger modifications can begin.

# General Information on the original amplifier:

The whole base of this project was this little amplifier that could. It seemed more of a curiosity or a gateway to higher level vacuum tube amplifiers, from around 2013 onwards. I found it fastinating. Working from memory, this small curiosity actually seemed to get some praise. There was a lot of cheap Chinese valve amplifiers on sale at this time and it seemed like a lot of them were complete trash or didn't even use the vacuum tube. This was the cheapest vacuum tube headphone amp around at the time. I don't know if there is a replacement for this by someone else these days; I feel that it's legacy should live on.

Many of the more invested audio geeks will say it sound bad. That is unfair. It does not sound bad at all, in fact it sound good. I think everyone has heard bad sounding audio equipment, they know how bad it sounds. The threshhold of sounding good, doesn't change based on how much better higher level equipment sounds. Justification for your high level spending changes the threshold of good sounding. There are better things out there of course. At the time this thing with some small modifications could compete with amplifiers and 4 times the price (based on what I've read).

So why not carry on the legacy of an absolute entry level vacuum tube headphone amplifier. Even with the cost of high quality components, the cost of this isn't far beyond the price of these things originaly. I think they were around Â£60 at the cheapest. With all parts needed and the PCB it isn't far off. The price of a decent vacuum tube will throw the budget out the window. You could use a 12AU7/ECC82 or a 5963 vacuum tube. Some of the cheapest vacuum tubes at the time offered some great sound. The included Chinese vacuum tube wasn't great honestly. Changing the included vacuum tube is the best improvement you can make, followed by ever deminishing returns. The idea of the best soudning valve is a whole other story and therfore up to you to decide what is best, but don't discount the cheap ones, you can find something that sounds good to you. Different genres of music match other tubes better. Over the years I settled on a Brimar 12AU7 that was brand new from someone I knew.

I hope that anyone who wants to experiment with vacuum tubes can find some enjoyment from this project. It doesn't have to be an expensive hobby. It should be something that is fun and within your budget. If you can't afford the best stuff out there, then don't worry, there are a lot of cheap options out there like this little amplifier that could.

# Changelog:

Changes from version 1 to version 1.1 are as follows:

Capacitor silk screen orientation corrected. Used wrong symbols in the schematic and it caused the footprint to be totally random.

Volume potentiometer wired weird. I could have caught this but I didn't. Schematic symbol not very clear honestly.

Volume potentiometer position moved slightly.

TO220 packages moved slightly closer to heatsinks.

Headphone output footprint backwards. Impossible to know without having the component to look at and reference to the footprint.

Swapped the left and right input caps to actually be on the left and right. Why I crossed them over I don't know. Makes no difference, I just like to have left on the left and rightr on the right.

Added L and R to input jack footprint. If not using colour coded jacks you can tell the difference. If using colour coded jacks you can see which to put where.

# Future revisions:

USB-C power supply. It can be done. How complex it may be, I do not know. This needs 24v and max USB-C power is 20v? I'm not sure, but it would be a very nice additon. A nice linear regulated power supply would be best, but this is a cheap fun toy.

Once proven to be a working amplifier, I would like to make many more serious modifications. The best way is to do them one at a time to allow easier troubleshooting if required.

Add some power filtering such as a choke or some inductor. I need to learn more about the effects of this, what is best and how to calculate it.

First major modification I would like to do is remove the valve heaters from the audio signal path. This helps with sound quality as it causes crosstalk between channels. This will require much larger heat sinks for the current regulators as they will have to deal with an extra 6.3v. Along with a separate 6.3v power supply for the heaters whether on the board regulating 24v down to 6.3v or completely separate.

In general I would like to use bigger heatsinks on everything to keep things much cooler. The standard heatsinks are a burn hazard. They run very hot. This has not proven to be an issue with reliability.

Do more work on laying out the board to keep each channel separated as best as possible, also keep input and output signal paths separated. Need to learn more about PCB design to improve this.

Adjustable output resistor for impedance matching headphones. This should be a simple mod by adding another dual wipe pot along side the volume control pot.

Input gain switch. Probably add a selectable resistor to the input volume pot to tame the volume. You barely have to turn this thing 45 degrees from 0 and it blows out your ears. More control of the dial would be better while allowing it to be switched out to run higher impedance headphones. This will also allow you to compensate for running higher output impedance values by allowing more input signal in and lower output values you can switch in a higher resistance.

Adjustable plate voltage would also be a great option for using different valves. In general the low voltage being used isn't optimal for the valve as it is but adding more flexibility can't be a bad option.

Higher running voltage. This will probably be the hardest to implement. It most probably will not work with this design or require many parallel parts to distribute extra power losses. This will also make the size much much bigger than before. Probably double the voltage to 48v and quadruple the amount of MOSFETS and different current regulation.

Find out truly what the fuck the two small transistors are that feed the valve anode. I have looked at all kinds of things from constant current sources and current mirrors. I don't se why they are even needed, but as the original Chinese design used them while cuttings costs everywhere, they must be needed.

Is it possible to create a true balanced headphone output. I need to learn much more about amplifier design and the workings of balanced amplifiers to do this. It might not even be possible with this design.

Using of different valves from the family like a 12AX7 and 12AT7. Again my not be possible to make anything good but worth a look at.
